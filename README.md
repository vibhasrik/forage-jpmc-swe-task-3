# JPMC Task 3: Display data visually for traders

This project uses perspective to generate a live graph that displays the data feed in a clear and visually appealing way for traders to monitor.

The purpose of this graph is to monitor and determine when a trading opportunity may arise as a result of the temporary weakening of a correlation between two stock prices. Given this graph, the trader are able to quickly and easily notice when the ratio moves too far from the average historical correlation. In this first instance, we'll assume that threshold is +/-5% of the 12-month historical average ratio.
